# nvim-conf

A fast, powerful, and modular PDE configuration for neovim powered by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

WARNING: Currently unfinished

## Key principles

### Modularity

Each plugin is self-contained within its own config file, removing the config file removes the plugin.

### Plug and Play

As long as all dependencies are installed, opening neovim will automatically install everything.

### Speed

Lazy loading wherever possible

## Installation

Clone the repository into ~/.config/nvim
